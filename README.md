# VectorDrawable2Svg

This script converts a VectorDrawable file into an SVG file

A fork of [AlessandroLucchet's script](https://gitlab.com/AlessandroLucchet/VectorDrawable2Svg) with additional improvements and modifications

Originally forked in [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/lalugue/VectorDrawable2Svg), this project has now been exported to Github! Future modifications and improvements will be added in this Github repository

## Usage and Example

If one wants to convert a file named foo.xml, place the file in the same folder as VectorDrawable2Svg.py

Then, run the following command in the terminal/command prompt

```
python VectorDrawable2Svg.py foo.xml
```

The script will then convert the .xml file and create a file named foo.svg
